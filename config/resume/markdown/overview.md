I’m a software engineer with a love for open source and life-long learning. I'm experienced in full-stack JavaScript development with React and Node.js, though I'm always interested in learning new technologies. Each new concept, language, tool, or library I learn gives me a better understanding of the bigger picture in software development — and my favourite way to do it is to dive into the source code of an OSS project.

**I'm looking to work with excellent people to solve interesting and challenging problems, and learn a lot along the way.** (Likewise? [Let's chat!][chat])
